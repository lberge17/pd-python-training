# Python CLI Projects

## Requirements

1. CLI should only terminate via user input
2. Uses Object Orientation
3. Must have at least a CLI class with 1 model class that represents some sort of data (from a file, API, or etc)
4. Data doesnâ€™t need to persist
5. Can be a solo or pairing project

Optionally can use [Enoch's Python CLI generator](https://github.com/Enoch2k2/python-project-generator) to get started :)
