Lesson Notes:

* THINGS TO METNION *

* Start by opening two terminals side by Slides
* one for python and one for ruby

Use sytax in read me to create a class both for python and ruby

Differences: 
    1. Python with the same sort of syntax you dont have to create an attr_accessor for your variables
        1. try d.tricks in python and d.tricks in ruby


--- 
Python’s class mechanism adds classes with a minimum of new syntax and semantics. It is a mixture of the
class mechanisms found in C++ and Modula-3. 

 they are created at runtime, and can be modified further after creation.

the method function is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided 
implicitly by the call.
